# shifa
Objective of shifa is to create an online portal for donating blood or to find a donor to decrease the distance between them. Shifa also aims to digitalize the process of appointment and paying consultation fees of the doctors. The services provided are: Find a blood donor- A blood donor can be found in the nearby areas. Donate Blood - Online connection between donor and recipient. Book an appointment with the nearby doctors - Providing proper receipts to the users, online appointment booking is done through our website. We have dreamt of digitalizing India and stop the increase of black money and hence have incorporated virtual money which will be available on donating blood. The users /blood donors can avail the drops as discount while consulting doctors and pay the fees online through the payment gateway available soon.

What makes us different from the current ideas related to this field present on web? 1) We have used machine learning to provide the blood donors with maximum probability of donating blood unlike other online blood donation portal. 2) We have also provided the virtual payment as well as tokens which can be earned by donating blood so as to increase the blood donation .

By taking the services of Shifa to all the major cities as well as providing the emergency helpline number and contacting all the working hospitals and doctors to register themselves on Shifa and avail the services by improving the authentication of donating blood .
